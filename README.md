# Using ChatGPT for Cyber Threat Intelligence
# How ChatGPT can be used for CTI with a simple Python script?

```
import requests

# Set the API endpoint and parameters
api_url = 'https://api.chatgpt.com/threatintel/v1'
query = 'suspicious IP address'

# Set the API key in the headers
headers = {
    'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
}

# Set the payload
payload = {
    'text': query
}

# Send a POST request to the API endpoint
response = requests.post(
    url=api_url,
    headers=headers,
    json=payload
)

# Check if the response is OK
if response.ok:
    # Get the results
    results = response.json()['results']
    for result in results:
        print(result['text'])
else:
    # Print the error message
    print(f'An error occurred: {response.text}')
```

# In this code, you need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your ChatGPT API key. You also need to set the query variable to the threat intelligence query that you want to search for. The code sends a POST request to the ChatGPT API with the provided query and API key and then prints the results returned by the API.
